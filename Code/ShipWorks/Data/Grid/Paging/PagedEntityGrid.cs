        // time that happens, we just maintain our own virtual selection.
        #region Big Explanation
        // It all is the ultimate result of this problem:
        //   Given a shitton of selected rows, with a filter with a ton of content, when a filter is known to have changed, know which rows are selected once the grid is reloaded.
        //   1) You select a whole bunch of stuff.  The grid knows exactly what rows are selected.  No problem here.  The grid knows what row indexes are selected, ShipWorks knows what data objects they correspond to.
        //   2) Someone somewhere changes a data object, which causes the filters to be refigured within SQL Server.  ShipWorks detects this.  It has to reload the grid.   Some data objects may have been added, some removed, or they could have just been edited.
        //   3) Some of the data objects may now be gone that were selected.  Some that were selected may still be matching the filter, but due to the sort order, an what other stuff was added or removed, they could easily have a different row index in the grid.
        //   4) Due to the fact that data is paged, the row index where some previously selected data object is after reloading may be one that’s not paged in.  Therefore, ShipWorks has no idea what row indexes to tell the grid are selected.
        //   5) ShipWorks does know what data objects should be selected - it just has konw way of knowing which rows indexes in the grid they are.
        //   6) Entire what, within the class, i call the “virtual selection”.  Everyone who deals with the grid from the outside sees the virtual selection, which is the data objects that are selected - not the actual grid rows that the grid thinks is selected.
        //   7) As you scroll through the grid, and rows are paged in, ShipWorks determines of the paged in row is one of the data objects in the virtual selection, and tells the grid to select that row index, so that when you are scrolling through, all the correct rows look like they are selected, as they get set to selected just-in-time.
        //   Enter the problem at hand:
        //   8) So there are 1000 items in the virtual selection.  10 of them are on screen, and the grid only knows that those 10 are selected.  You click on some random row that is not selected.  Which should clear the rest of the selection, which the grid does - but! only to the 10 it knows about.
        //   9) ShipWorks needs to know when this is happening, so it can clear the virtual selection as well.
        //   10) This is made worse by the fact that when the grid calls “Clear” on the selection collection, it’s not virtual.  But I can inject my custom ArrayList.  However, the grid optimizes when there are few selected items, and calls ArrayList.RemoveAt on each one, instead of ArrayList.Clear.  So to know if SelectedElementCollectino.Clear is really being called, you have to walk the stack from RemoveAt.
        //   11) Once you know that SelectedElementCollection.Clear is being called, it could be called for one of two reasons.  a) To actually do a full clear like I gave an example of.  b) Sometimes to add element X to the selction, it caches the selection, clears it, then adds back in cache + X.
        //   In case b) it WOULD have added back in the virtual selection had it known about it, so we have to detect whether its case a (and the virtual selection should be cleared) or b (and the virtual selection should stay)        #endregion
