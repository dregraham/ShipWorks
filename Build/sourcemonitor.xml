        or current file extensions (set in the Options dialog) for source
        files to be included in a new checkpoint. All files with the
        extensions you specify here will be included in the new checkpoint.

        Export of metrics data is supported for a single checkpoint per
        command (the one identified in the <checkpoint_name> tag or one that
        is automatically created as explained below). Exported metrics data
        is specified by the export type: "1" for the project summary as XML,
        "2" for checkpoint details as XML, or "3" project details as CSV.
        You specify the type with a number 1, 2 or 3 in the element's
        contents. All other text is ignored. The following examples are
        all valid specification of export type 2:
          <export_type>2 (project details as XML)</export_type>
          <export_type>Project details as XML: 2</export_type>
          <export_type>2</export_type>

        If you do not specify a checkpoint name, a name will be created for
        you in the form "CheckpointN" where N is the next higher number not
        already present in an auto-generated checkpoint name in this
        project.
